# Purpose
I want to follow along with different sources of LSTM tutorials to better understand it myself.


# Files
* Vanilla_LSTM.ipynb: Contains Jeff Heaton's car passing a camera simulated experiment. 
A very simple vanilla LSTM that will try to predict the "color" of a "passing car".

* Stacked_LSTM.ipynb: Contains Jason Brownlee's damped sine wave simulated experiment.
An LSTM that can understand the dual time variance of a sine wave whose amplitude decreases exponentially.
I included a little matplotlib of my favorite reconstructed yhat.
